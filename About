SkyCast Weather App
A dynamic, fully responsive weather dashboard built with PHP and JavaScript. This application fetches real-time weather data and 5-day forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API, featuring a modern "Glassmorphism" UI that adapts visually to current weather conditions.

🚀 Features
Real-Time Data: Displays current temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and visibility.

5-Day Forecast: Horizontal scroll view for upcoming weather in 3-hour intervals.

Dynamic Backgrounds: The background gradient changes automatically based on the weather (Sunny, Rainy, Snowy, etc.).

Backend Proxy (PHP): Secures the API key by making requests server-side instead of exposing it in the frontend code.

Smart Caching: Implements file-based JSON caching to minimize API calls and improve load times.

Glassmorphism UI: Modern, translucent design using CSS backdrop-filter.

Error Handling: Robust handling for invalid city names and network issues.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).

Backend: PHP (cURL, File Handling).

API: OpenWeatherMap API.

Server: Apache (via XAMPP/WAMP).

⚙️ Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to run the project locally on your machine.

Prerequisites
XAMPP (or any local PHP server) installed.

An active API Key from OpenWeatherMap (Free tier).

Steps
Clone the Repository Navigate to your XAMPP htdocs folder and clone this repo:

Bash
cd C:/xampp/htdocs/
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
Configure API Key Open weather.php in your code editor and find the configuration section:

PHP
// weather.php
$apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"; // Replace with your actual OpenWeatherMap Key
Start the Server

Open the XAMPP Control Panel.

Start the Apache module.

Run the App Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost/weather-app/

📂 Project Structure
Plaintext
weather-app/
├── cache/              # Auto-generated folder for JSON cache files
├── index.html          # Main user interface
├── script.js           # Frontend logic (DOM manipulation, Fetch API)
├── weather.php         # Backend logic (API Proxy, Caching, SSL handling)
└── README.md           # Project documentation
🧠 How It Works
User Input: The user enters a city name in index.html.

Request: script.js sends a request to weather.php (e.g., weather.php?city=London).

Cache Check: weather.php checks if a valid cache file exists for that city (created within the last hour).

If yes: It serves the data immediately from the JSON file.

If no: It fetches fresh data from OpenWeatherMap, saves it to a file, and then serves it.

Rendering: The frontend receives the JSON, updates the DOM elements, and adjusts the CSS background based on the weather.main condition.

🔮 Future Improvements
Add Geolocation support to automatically detect user location.

Add a toggle for Celsius/Fahrenheit.

Implement a "Recent Searches" history using LocalStorage.
